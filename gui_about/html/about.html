The <b>3DCityDB Tools</b> plug-in facilitates management and visualization of data stored in the free and open-source <b>3D City Database</b> (aka 3DCityDB), which currently supports CityGML v. 1.0 and 2.0.
<br/><br/>
The plug-in allows to connect to local or remote instances of the 3DCityDB for PostgreSQL/PostGIS and to load data as "classical" layers into QGIS. Once data layers are available in QGIS, the user can interact with them as usual, i.e. perform analyses, work with associated attributes, explore and visualise the data in 2D and 3D, etc. Additionally, data in the database can be deleted, either using classical QGIS editing tools, or bulk-wise.
<br/><br/>
As semantic 3D city models tend to be huge datasets and are generally best managed in spatial databases, the main idea behind the development of this plug-in is to facilitate access and use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityGML">CityGML</a> or <a href="https://www.cityjson.org/">CityJSON</a> data for those practitioners that lack a deep knowledge of the international standard <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml">OCG CityGML data model</a>, and/or have limited experience with SQL/Spatial-RDBMSs in general.
<br/><br/>
This plug-in has been developed at the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/">3DGeoinformation group</a> of TU Delft since 2021.
