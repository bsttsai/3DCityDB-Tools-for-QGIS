description=Tools to visualize and manipulate CityGML data stored in the 3D City Database
version=0.7.0 (February 2023)

about=This plugin connects to the 3D City Database (v. 4.x) for PostgreSQL/PostGIS. It consists of:
 
 - The "Layer Loader": it loads data as "classical" layers into QGIS. All CityGML LoDs are supported, as well as multiple citydb schemas and multiple database users. Feature attributes can be edited, changes are stored back directly into the database;

 - A "Bulk Deleter": it allows to cleanup the database, or to delete selected feature types;

 - "QGIS Package Administration": it allows to install the server-side part of the plug-in, and to manage database user privileges.

 Further details can be found in the \user_guide subfolder of the plugin installation directory (see file "3DCityDBLoader_UserGuide.pdf").
