about=This plugin connects to the 3D City Database (v. 4.x) for PostgreSQL/PostGIS and  loads data as "classical" layers into QGIS. All CityGML LoDs are supported, as well as multiple citydb schemas and multiple database users. Feature attributes can be edited, changes are stored back directly into the database. 

 Further details can be found in the \user_guide subfolder of the plugin installation directory (see file "3DCityDBLoader_UserGuide.pdf"). 

 Some datasets for testing purposes are delivered, too, and are contained in the \test_datasets subfolder.
