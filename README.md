# Disclamer
This work started as a MSc Thesis in Geomatics by Konstantinos Pantelios, if you might like to read his work it is available [here]([here](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:fb532bef-81b9-482b-921a-e7ce907cb544)).

The 3DGeoinformation group decided to create a fork of the initial GitHub repository to keep the track of all previous issues and suggestions by early testers and of course the authorship of the developers.

# 3DCityDB-Loader for QGIS
This repository is created to manage code concerning the development of a QGIS plugin that facilitates data visualization of relational database 3DCityDB.
