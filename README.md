# Disclaimer
This work started as a TU Delft MSc Thesis in Geomatics by Konstantinos Pantelios. If you would like to read more about his work, it is available [here](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:fb532bef-81b9-482b-921a-e7ce907cb544).

The 3DGeoinformation at TU Delft has created this fork of the initial GitHub repository to keep track of all previous issues and suggestions by early testers, and to continue development in the future.

# 3DCityDB-Loader for QGIS
